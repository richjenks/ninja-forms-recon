# Post Form Name

Adds the hidden field `_form_name` to all forms

As per http://ninjaforms.com/documentation/developer-api/code-examples/using-extra-field-values/ it is ignored by Ninja Forms (so you're not storing the form name in each form submission) but it's still available to developers and other plugins.
